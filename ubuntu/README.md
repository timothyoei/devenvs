# Ubuntu Development Environment
You can start the development environment in one of two ways: 1) fetch the setup script and run it on an Ubuntu host or 2) start the docker container and run the script

For option 1,
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timothyoei/devenv/main/ubuntu/setup_ubuntu.sh
chmod +x setup_ubuntu.sh
./setup_ubuntu.sh
```
